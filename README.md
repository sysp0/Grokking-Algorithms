This repository contains my personal notes and code examples from the book "Grokking Algorithms." I created this repository to document my learning journey and practice Python programming while exploring various algorithms covered in the book.

# Introduction
The book "Grokking Algorithms" provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental algorithms and data structures. In this repository, I will be sharing my notes and code implementations as I progress through the book's chapters.

# Getting Started
To get started with the notes and code examples, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sysp0/grokking-algorithms.git
```
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine to run the code examples.

# Usage
Each chapter of the book will have its corresponding directory within this repository. Inside each chapter directory, you will find detailed notes and Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of algorithms discussed in that chapter.

To access the notes and code examples for a specific chapter, simply navigate to the corresponding directory. For example, to explore the first lesson on the introduction to algorithms, you can click on the following link:

Feel free to explore the code examples, modify them, and experiment with different inputs. You can also refer to the accompanying notes for a better understanding of the algorithms and their applications.
