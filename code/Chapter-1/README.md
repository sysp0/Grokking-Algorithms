# Binary Search Examples

This repository contains Python code examples related to binary search algorithms. Each code example is located in
a separate directory. Below is a brief description of each example:

## Code Example 1

The `[binary_search_1.py](binary_search_1.py)` directory contains a function-based implementation of binary search.

The code file, `binary_search_1.py`, includes a `binary_search` function that takes a sorted list and a target item as input 
and returns the index of the item if found, or `None` if the item is not present in the list. The file also includes 
a few example usages of the `binary_search` function.

## Code Example 2

The `code2[binary_search_2.py](binary_search_2.py)` directory provides a class-based implementation of binary search.

The code file, `binary_search_2.py`, includes a `BinarySearch` class that is initialized with a sorted list.
The class has a `binary_search` method that can be used to find the index of a target item within the list.
The file demonstrates how to use the `BinarySearch` class by performing binary search on a sorted list.

## Usage

To run the code examples, navigate to the respective directory and execute the corresponding code file using Python.
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

```bash
python code/Chapter-1/binary_search_1.py
```


```bash
python code/Chapter-1/binary_search_2.py
```
